# Privacy And Data Reference

Libroo is a physical-first library system. This document describes the application data model and the privacy behavior operators should understand. It is implementation-grounded in `server/db/schema/auth.ts` and `server/db/schema/domain.ts`; it is not legal advice.

## Stored Data Categories

### Users, Sessions, And Accounts

The `user` table stores the Better Auth user record: `id`, required `name`, unique required `email`, `email_verified`, nullable `pending_email`, nullable `image`, nullable `terms_accepted_at`, role and ban state, and timestamps. Roles are stored in Better Auth's `role` field. Ban state is stored in `banned`, `ban_reason`, and `ban_expires`.

The `session` table stores active session records: token, expiry, creation/update timestamps, nullable IP address, nullable user agent, nullable `impersonated_by`, and the owning user. Sessions cascade-delete with the user. `impersonated_by` remains in the schema because Better Auth supports it, but Libroo blocks impersonation permanently at middleware level.

The admin users screen labels the latest `session.updated_at` value as **Last session update**. It is derived from Better Auth session refreshes and is not per-request activity; no additional session column or activity-tracking mechanism has been added.

The `account` table stores authentication account records: provider identifiers, the owning user, optional provider tokens, password hash, token expiry timestamps, scope, and creation/update timestamps. Accounts cascade-delete with the user.

The `verification` table stores Better Auth verification state: identifier, value, expiry, and optional creation/update timestamps. It is used for email verification, email-change verification, and password-reset style verification records.

### Books And Library Entries

The `books` table stores canonical or manual book metadata: ISBN, title, cover path, Open Library edition/work keys, description, publish date, publishers, page count, source (`open_library` or `manual`), optional creator user, and creation timestamp. Open Library rows are shared catalog metadata. Manual rows may be user-created; the creator reference is set null if the creator account is deleted.

The `authors`, `book_authors`, `tags`, and `book_system_tags` tables are shared dictionaries and relationships. They do not directly store user account ownership. User-curated tags attach through `user_book_tags`.

The `locations` table stores a user's physical shelf/location tree. Location rows include the owner user, optional parent location, display name, normalized name, path, depth, and timestamps. Locations cascade-delete with the owner.

The `user_books` table stores a user's library entries: owner user, book reference, optional location, optional rating, optional private note, reading status, optional current page, optional progress percent, reading dates, added date, and optional removed date. User library entries cascade-delete with the owner.

The `user_book_tags` table stores user-curated tags on a specific user library entry and cascades with that entry.

### Loans

The `loans` table stores lending records for a user's physical copy. Each loan has a required owner user, required user-book record, nullable borrower user, required borrower display name, nullable borrower email, an optional owner-private note (up to 1,000 characters), status, loan/due/return/cancel timestamps, book and owner snapshots, optional accept token hash, optional accepted timestamp, and creation/update timestamps.

Borrower privacy details:

- `borrower_user_id` is nullable and uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`; it is set when a borrower accepts an invite with an account.
- `borrower_display_name` is required and frozen as a snapshot at loan time. It may be an account user's display name or a third-party name supplied by the owner.
- `borrower_email` is nullable. It is optional contact data supplied by the owner and is not included in library CSV export.
- `borrower_name_normalized` and `borrower_email_normalized` are owner-scoped lookup keys derived from those snapshot fields. They support borrower suggestions in the lending form and are not exposed to clients.
- `note` is an owner-private note. It is never included in borrower, invitation-preview, or other public-facing loan responses.
- `snapshot_book_title`, `snapshot_book_author`, `snapshot_cover_path`, and `snapshot_owner_name` preserve the lending context even if the live book/user data changes later.

If a borrower deletes their account, Libroo anonymizes the borrowed-loan association by clearing `borrower_user_id` and `accepted_at`, while retaining the owner's loan row and owner-supplied borrower snapshot text. If an owner deletes their account, owned loan rows are deleted.

Borrower suggestions are derived from an authenticated owner's own loan rows; Libroo does not maintain a shared people or contacts directory. Results are filtered by owner in the database, deduplicated by normalized name and email, and ordered by most recent loan usage. Permanently deleting a closed loan immediately removes that row as a suggestion source, although another retained matching loan may still produce the same suggestion. Deleting the owner account removes all owned loans and therefore all of its borrower suggestions. Deleting a borrower's account does not remove owner-supplied snapshot text under the retention behavior above, so that retained history may continue to produce a suggestion for its owner.

### Signup Invites And Email Verification State

The `signup_invites` table stores invite lifecycle state: token hash, optional invited email, status, creator user, optional accepted user, reservation token and reservation timestamps, expiry, accepted/revoked timestamps, and creation/update timestamps. Invites created by a deleted user are deleted. Invites accepted by a deleted user may remain for the inviter with `accepted_by_user_id` cleared.

Email verification state is split between `user.email_verified`, `user.pending_email`, and `verification` records. `pending_email` holds the requested new email during the custom verified email-change flow. Better Auth clears it after successful verification.

### Admin Audit Log

The `admin_audit_log` table stores security and admin audit events: category (`admin` or `auth`), nullable actor user, nullable target user, action, optional JSON metadata, and creation timestamp. Actor and target foreign keys use `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so audit rows can survive user deletion without keeping a live account reference.

## Admin Capabilities And Limits

Admins can:

- View users.
- Change user roles.
- Ban and unban users.
- View the admin audit log.
- Create and revoke signup invites.
- Revoke sessions through Better Auth admin session capabilities.

Enforced limits from `server/utils/libroo-admin-auth-plugin.ts`:

- The first created user is automatically promoted to admin when the database has no existing admin.
- Admins cannot remove admin rights from themselves.
- Admins cannot ban themselves.
- The last active admin cannot be demoted.
- The last active unbanned admin cannot be banned.
- Last-admin checks are also enforced for self-service account deletion.

Impersonation is intentionally disabled. Requests to `/admin/impersonate-user` and `/admin/stop-impersonating` always fail with `FORBIDDEN` and `IMPERSONATION_DISABLED`. The `session.impersonated_by` column is residual unused Better Auth schema. Re-enabling impersonation requires an intentional future sprint with privacy, audit, UI, and operator policy work.

Deliberately unaudited domain actions:

- Loan create, return, and cancel.
- Book add, delete, import, and export.
- Location create, rename, and delete.
- Successful sign-in.

Email-verification configuration is controlled by deployment environment variables, not by admins inside the app, so configuration changes are out of scope for in-app audit logging.

### Metrics Dashboard

The admin metrics dashboard shows aggregate, instance-level operational metadata, not per-user analytics. Its user, canonical-book, active-library-entry, active-loan, location, and tag figures are aggregate counts. Approximate cover-blob storage usage is derived from a scheduled storage calculation, not per-request activity, and is shown with its `lastCalculatedAt` time.

## Export, Deletion, And Retention Notes

The library CSV export is a versioned transfer format for the current user's library. It includes current book/library fields, source identifiers used for conservative deduplication, and at most one active loan snapshot. It does not include borrower email or historical loan rows. See [Account Deletion And Retention](./account-deletion.md) for deletion mechanics and operator support guidance.

Interactive ISBN lookup uses registered metadata providers. Open Library is included by default. Offline provider snapshots are checked locally; remote providers receive the ISBN and the server's network address, but no user account email, session cookies, loans, locations, notes or ratings.

Editing a saved book creates private metadata for that library entry. Other users’ shared catalog metadata is not changed. The stable library entry keeps its personal data and loans; background enrichment on the old metadata cannot overwrite the edit. Unreferenced older private metadata is removed, and replaced private cover files are cleaned up only when no book references them.

The `catalog_request_state` table holds one operational row per supplemental provider: request timing and lease, daily count, failure/cooldown state, and cached public robots policy. It contains no ISBNs, account identifiers or reading history. It coordinates outbound requests across application instances and keeps block decisions after restarts.

CSV imports remain user-created manual records unless a trusted Libroo export points to the same Open Library edition. Metadata enrichment is disabled by default. When a user explicitly enables it, Libroo sends valid imported ISBNs to Open Library in a background job. Provider metadata is added without replacing the imported title, authors, or manual cover. The job state stores the user, imported book, ISBN, attempts, timing, and bounded diagnostic messages; it does not make the imported manual record available to other users.

The Settings importer sends sequential requests of up to 25 rows, reduced for rows with many authors, tags or location levels. Each request fetches matching records and dimensions in one database batch, then normally commits all planned writes in a second batch. A rejected SQL batch rolls back together and is split into smaller batches to isolate rejected rows while preserving valid row results. It shows processed-row progress and keeps the final created/updated/skipped counts and original CSV row errors visible in a result dialog. Each request commits successful rows independently; a later failed request does not roll back earlier imports. If a request fails, importing stops, and the report advises retrying the same file with **Keep existing data**. The result report is held in the current Settings page, not saved as a server-side audit record. The collapsed **Show row details** section lists each reported CSV row, its outcome, the matching rule (Libroo ID, ISBN, or title and author), and a link to the user’s matching record. Repeated matches within the same CSV identify the first row that handled that record, including across batches. The summary distinguishes books already in the library before this import from repeated rows handled earlier in the same CSV; those categories do not overlap. Updated/skipped counts describe row outcomes and include CSV repeats, which do not create additional books. Filters separate pre-import library matches, repeated CSV rows, and errors. If row details are missing, the report does not guess the match origin. Interrupted requests mark their rows unconfirmed; later unsent rows are labelled not processed. Matching an existing record does not necessarily mean the library contains duplicate copies.

Duplicate detection matches ISBN, or title plus a matching author when no ISBN is supplied, across all locations. Title and author matching use consistent Unicode-aware case and whitespace normalization; SQLite ASCII-only `lower()` is not used for title comparisons. This prevents repeated imports of Slovak titles from creating new copies. Existing duplicate records are not automatically merged or deleted. A skipped duplicate does not create another physical copy or another location. Location values containing ` - ` represent a hierarchy, such as `Miša - BK` for the BK child under Miša. Wishlisted books are separate from owned inventory and do not receive a physical location.


Key retention nuances:

- Borrowed-loan rows can remain after a borrower account is deleted, with the borrower account link and accepted state cleared.
- Admin audit rows survive user deletion with actor/target foreign keys nulled.
- Shared Open Library metadata can remain after account deletion because it is shared catalog data.
- Backups can retain deleted data until the operator's retention window expires.


Saved-book refresh previews contact only registered metadata providers using the
ISBN supplied in the editor. Existing titles, descriptions, notes, locations,
ratings and lending records are not sent. Results stay in the editor until the
user selects fields and explicitly saves. Preview requests do not persist books,
images or enrichment jobs; provider caches and operational request counters may
be updated. Optional cover lookup contacts Open Library separately.

### Library layout

The library offers cover shelves grouped by location and a grid view. The first shelf request returns a bounded preview from every non-empty shelf, including books without a location; shelves are not discovered through global book pagination. Filters apply before grouping. Swipe a shelf or use its arrows to browse loaded books. Grid and shelf pages are cached separately. Counts refer to loaded results; **Load More** fetches the next batch from each shelf and moves the relevant shelf to the first newly loaded book. Searching and selecting books use the grid. Tags are clickable filters.

The `libroo-library-layout` first-party preference cookie remembers the chosen layout in the current browser; it contains only `shelves` or `grid`, not book or account data. Coverless books use local title-and-author jackets and do not trigger additional external requests.

### Bulk-operation performance

Import lookup queries use existing owner/name indexes and bounded parameter lists. Normal 658-row files need 27 HTTP requests rather than 220. Reads are cached within the request, including records staged earlier in the same CSV batch. A repeated import using **Keep existing data** can finish with only the lookup batch. Complex rows use smaller batches, and direct API requests must obey the same bounds.

Bulk deletion sends up to 100 selected IDs per request. SQL chunks contain at most 90 IDs, with a guarded update and acknowledgement SELECT in one database transaction. This stays below D1’s 100-parameter statement limit, protects active loans, and safely acknowledges already removed records after a lost response.

This follows Cloudflare’s guidance to [reduce D1 round trips using batches](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/worker-api/d1-database/#batch) and [respect per-statement limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/platform/limits/). Database round-trip counts are verified against the D1 emulator; production wall-clock speed depends on network latency and data complexity.
